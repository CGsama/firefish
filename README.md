# Release cycle

We use a rolling release cycle now. Small updates will be frequently merged into the main branch, so please upgrade regularly at your convenience. We will use the commit date (e.g., 20240206) as the version number.

Any special operations required for an upgrade (e.g., installing new dependencies, editing docker-compose.yml) will be noted on [docs/notice-for-admins.md](docs/notice-for-admins.md) , so please check it before upgrading.

**As always, please take a backup first before starting update.** Whether it is a server snapshot backup or a complete database and file backup, it will be of great help to your recovery process.

# Getting started

This guide will work for both **starting from scratch** and **migrating from Misskey**.
